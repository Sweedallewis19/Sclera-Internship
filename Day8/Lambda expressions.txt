Today we had to present on overview of whatever java concepts covered till date.
Today I learned about functional interfaces in Java. I understood that a functional interface contains only one abstract method and can be implemented using lambda expressions. This helps in writing cleaner and more concise code.
@FunctionalInterface
interface Printer {
    void print(String message);
}

I studied anonymous inner classes, which allow creating objects without explicitly defining a separate class. However, I noticed that they can make the code lengthy compared to newer approaches.

Printer p = new Printer() {
    public void print(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
};


I then learned about lambda expressions, which provide a shorter and more readable way to implement functional interfaces. Lambdas reduce boilerplate code and improve clarity.
Printer p = message -> System.out.println(message);

I also understood the concept of variable capture, where lambda expressions can access variables from the surrounding scope, but those variables must be effectively final.

I learned about method references, which are an even cleaner way to refer to existing methods using the :: operator, making the code more readable.

I explored built-in functional interfaces such as Predicate, Function, Supplier, and Consumer, which are provided in the java.util.function package.

I studied the Consumer interface and how consumer chaining works using methods like andThen(), allowing multiple operations to be executed in sequence.

Consumer<String> c1 = s -> System.out.println(s);
Consumer<String> c2 = s -> System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());

c1.andThen(c2).accept("hello");
