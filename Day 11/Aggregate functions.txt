Implemented data analysis operations using aggregate functions and grouping techniques to summarize and structure relational data efficiently. Applied grouping, filtering on aggregated results, and hierarchical summaries using rollup operations.

 Aggregate Functions

Used aggregate functions to perform calculations on grouped data such as total, average, minimum, maximum, and count.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;

SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders;

SELECT AVG(amount) FROM orders;

SELECT MIN(amount), MAX(amount) FROM orders;

 GROUP BY Clause

Grouped records based on specific columns to generate summarized reports.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

 HAVING Clause

Filtered grouped results using conditions on aggregated values.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 5000;

 ROLLUP Operator

Generated hierarchical summary rows along with grouped results.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id WITH ROLLUP;
