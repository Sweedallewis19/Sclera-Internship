Yesterday,I learned the basics of Java programming by watching the tutorial video.I understood how to install the Java Development Kit and run Java programs using an IDE intelliJ.
I learned about the structure of a Java program,how a class is written and how the main method works as the starting point of execution.
I also studied different primitive data types like int, long, float, double, byte, and Boolean and also reference data types like point, date etc and how they differ from primitive data types.
I understood concepts like operator precedence,integer division and how expressions such as x = x/y/z are calculated step by step.I also learned how to write and use functions to avoid repeating code,pass parameters and return values. 
Along with this I studied access modifiers such as public, private, protected.Also control flow statements like if, switch, and loops, and learned how to take user input and display output.
