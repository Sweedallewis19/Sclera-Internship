Implemented relational data retrieval across multiple tables using various SQL join techniques. Applied different join strategies based on data requirements and optimized queries for structured data relationships.

Inner Join

Used to retrieve matching records from two tables.

SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
ON c.id = o.customer_id;

 Joining Across Databases

Queried tables across different databases.

SELECT *
FROM db1.customers c
JOIN db2.orders o
ON c.id = o.customer_id;

 Self Join

Joined a table with itself to represent hierarchical relationships.

SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.id;

Joining Multiple Tables

Combined data from more than two tables.

SELECT o.order_id, c.name, p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id;

 Compound Join Conditions

Applied multiple conditions in join.

SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi
ON o.id = oi.order_id
AND o.customer_id = oi.customer_id;

 Implicit Join Syntax

Older join style using WHERE clause.

SELECT *
FROM customers c, orders o
WHERE c.id = o.customer_id;

 Outer Joins

Retrieved unmatched records.

Left Join:

SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.id = o.customer_id;


Right Join:

SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o
ON c.id = o.customer_id;

 Outer Join Between Multiple Tables
SELECT *
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON o.id = p.order_id;

 Self Outer Join
SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.id;

 USING Clause

Simplified join condition when column names match.

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers USING (customer_id);

 Natural Join

Automatically joins tables based on common column names.

SELECT *
FROM orders
NATURAL JOIN customers;

 Cross Join

Produced Cartesian product of tables.

SELECT *
FROM customers
CROSS JOIN products;

 Unions

Combined results from multiple SELECT statements.

SELECT name FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name FROM suppliers;
