Implemented database abstraction and query simplification using SQL views to enhance data security, reusability, and maintainability. Views were used to encapsulate complex queries and provide controlled access to underlying tables.

🔹 Creating Views

Created reusable virtual tables based on SELECT queries.

CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT c.id, c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

 Altering or Dropping Views

Modified existing views and removed them when required.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT id, name FROM customers;

DROP VIEW customer_orders;

 Updatable Views

Performed updates through views when they meet updatable conditions (single table, no aggregation).

UPDATE customer_orders
SET name = 'John Doe'
WHERE id = 1;

 WITH CHECK OPTION

Ensured data modifications through views comply with defined conditions.

CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active'
WITH CHECK OPTION;
