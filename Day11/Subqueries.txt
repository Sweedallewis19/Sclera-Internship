Implemented advanced data retrieval techniques using subqueries and conditional operators to perform dynamic filtering and analytical comparisons across related tables.

🔹 Subqueries

Used subqueries to retrieve data based on results of another query.

SELECT name
FROM customers
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders
);

🔹 Subqueries in the FROM Clause

Used subqueries as temporary tables for further filtering.

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS summary
WHERE total > 5000;

🔹 IN Operator with Subqueries

Filtered records using subquery results.

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT product_id FROM order_items
);

🔹 Subqueries vs Joins

Applied joins for relational data retrieval and subqueries for conditional filtering depending on performance and readability requirements.

-- Using Join
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

🔹 ALL Keyword

Compared values against all results of a subquery.

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > ALL (
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE category_id = 2
);

🔹 ANY Keyword

Compared values against any value from subquery results.

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > ANY (
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE category_id = 2
);

🔹 Correlated Subqueries

Used subqueries that reference outer query columns.

SELECT *
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
);

🔹 EXISTS Operator

Checked existence of related records.

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id
);

🔹 Subqueries in SELECT Clause

Used subqueries to compute dynamic values in result columns.

SELECT name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM orders
        WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id) AS order_count
FROM customers;
