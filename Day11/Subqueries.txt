Implemented advanced data retrieval techniques using subqueries and conditional operators to perform dynamic filtering and analytical comparisons across related tables.

Subqueries

Used subqueries to retrieve data based on results of another query.

SELECT name
FROM customers
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders
);

Subqueries in the FROM Clause

Used subqueries as temporary tables for further filtering.

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS summary
WHERE total > 5000;

 IN Operator with Subqueries

Filtered records using subquery results.

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT product_id FROM order_items
);

Subqueries vs Joins

Applied joins for relational data retrieval and subqueries for conditional filtering depending on performance and readability requirements.

-- Using Join
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

ALL Keyword

Compared values against all results of a subquery.

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > ALL (
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE category_id = 2
);

ANY Keyword

Compared values against any value from subquery results.

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > ANY (
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE category_id = 2
);

 Correlated Subqueries

Used subqueries that reference outer query columns.

SELECT *
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
);

 EXISTS Operator

Checked existence of related records.

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id
);

 Subqueries in SELECT Clause

Used subqueries to compute dynamic values in result columns.

SELECT name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM orders
        WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id) AS order_count

FROM customers;
