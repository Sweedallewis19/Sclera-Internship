Implemented automation and scheduled database tasks using triggers and events to maintain data integrity and enable auditing mechanisms. Configured database-level automation to execute operations automatically based on defined conditions.

Creating Triggers

Created triggers to automatically execute logic before or after INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_user
BEFORE INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
Viewing Triggers

Checked existing triggers in the database.

SHOW TRIGGERS;
Dropping Triggers

Removed triggers when no longer required.

DROP TRIGGER before_insert_user;
Using Triggers for Auditing

Implemented audit logging to track data modifications.

CREATE TRIGGER after_update_user
AFTER UPDATE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO users_audit(user_id, old_name, new_name, changed_at)
VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.name, NEW.name, NOW());
 Creating Events

Scheduled automated database tasks using events.

CREATE EVENT daily_cleanup
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
DO
DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
 Viewing Events
SHOW EVENTS;
 Dropping or Altering Events
DROP EVENT daily_cleanup;

ALTER EVENT daily_cleanup
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 7 DAY;
