Design and structured relational database models following normalization principles and best practices. Learned conceptual, logical, and physical database models to ensure scalability, maintainability, and data integrity.

Conceptual Model

Defined high-level system entities and relationships without focusing on technical implementation. Identified core business objects and mapped relationships between them.

 Logical Model

Converted conceptual entities into structured relational tables. Defined attributes, primary keys, and relationships while ensuring normalization principles were applied.

Physical Model

Implemented the logical model into MySQL with specific data types, indexes, constraints, and storage configurations.

Primary Keys

Assigned unique identifiers to ensure each record can be uniquely identified.

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
 Foreign Keys & Constraints

Established relationships between tables to maintain referential integrity.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

Link Tables (Many-to-Many Relationships)

Implemented junction tables to resolve many-to-many relationships.

CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);

Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)

Applied normalization rules to eliminate redundancy and ensure data consistency:

1NF – Eliminated repeating groups and ensured atomic values.

2NF – Removed partial dependency on composite keys.

3NF – Eliminated transitive dependencies.
