Today, I successfully installed MySQL and set up the database environment. I created my own database and practiced executing SQL queries. During the session, I learned various important database concepts and commands.

Creating Database

I created a database and selected it for use.

CREATE DATABASE internship_db;
USE internship_db;

Retrieving Data from a Single Table

I learned how to fetch data using the SELECT statement.

SELECT * FROM students;
SELECT name, age FROM students;

Retrieving Data from Multiple Tables (JOIN):
I understood how to combine data from multiple tables using joins.

SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.id;

Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data

I practiced modifying records using SQL commands.

INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 21);

UPDATE students
SET age = 22
WHERE name = 'Alice';

DELETE FROM students
WHERE name = 'Alice';

Summarizing Data
I learned to use aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;

Writing Complex Queries

I practiced using GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries.

SELECT course_id, COUNT(*)
FROM students
GROUP BY course_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Essential MySQL Functions

I explored built-in functions for string and date handling.

SELECT UPPER(name) FROM students;
SELECT NOW();

Views

I created a view to simplify complex queries.

CREATE VIEW student_view AS
SELECT name, age FROM students;

Stored Procedures

I learned how to create reusable SQL blocks.

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetStudents()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM students;
END //
DELIMITER ;

Triggers

I understood how triggers automatically execute after certain events.

CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_student
BEFORE INSERT ON students
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.age = IF(NEW.age < 0, 0, NEW.age);

Transactions and Concurrency

I practiced transaction control using:

START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;

I learned different data types such as:
INT
VARCHAR
DATE
DECIMAL

Indexing for Performance
I created indexes to improve query speed.
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON students(name);

Securing Databases

I understood basic security practices such as user privileges.
GRANT SELECT ON internship_db.* TO 'user1'@'localhost';
