Implemented data retrieval and filtering using core SQL query clauses in MySQL. Practiced building structured queries for sorting, limiting, and filtering records efficiently.

SELECT Statement

Used to retrieve data from tables.

SELECT * FROM customers;

 SELECT Specific Columns
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;

 WHERE Clause

Filtered records based on conditions.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE state = 'CA';

 AND, OR, NOT Operators

Used logical operators for multiple conditions.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE state = 'CA' AND points > 1000;

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE NOT state = 'TX';

 IN Operator

Simplified multiple OR conditions.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE state IN ('CA', 'TX', 'NY');

 BETWEEN Operator

Filtered within a range.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000;

 LIKE Operator

Used pattern matching with wildcards.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';

 REGEXP Operator

Performed advanced pattern matching.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field$';

 IS NULL Operator

Checked for NULL values.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE phone IS NULL;

 ORDER BY Clause

Sorted query results.

SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY points DESC;

 LIMIT Clause

Restricted number of returned records.

SELECT * FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
